# Hello World Program

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

With this simple program I wanted to play around with .gitignore files along with a simple program displaying "Hello, World." It works!

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
